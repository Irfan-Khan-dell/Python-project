⚙️ Installation & Setup

1.Clone the repository

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-predictor.git

2.Navigate to the project directory

Bash
cd stock-price-predictor

3.Install required dependencies

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

4.Run the application
Bash
python app.py



📌 How It Works

1.Historical stock price data is collected from an online API
2.Data is cleaned and preprocessed
A machine learning model is trained on past prices
3.The model predicts future prices based on learned patterns
4.Results are displayed graphically for better understanding
eg.
Line chart comparing Actual Price vs Predicted Price
Predicted stock value for selected date range



🎯 Use Cases
Stock market trend analysis
Learning time-series forecasting
Prediction of future asset value
